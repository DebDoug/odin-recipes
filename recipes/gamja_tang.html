        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons (5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt use half as much by volume or the same
            weight</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 small white onion (about 5 1/4 ounces; 150g), quartered</li>
        <li>9 medium garlic cloves (45g), finely chopped</li>
        <li>One 2-inch piece (about 1 ounce; 25g) fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons (45g) doenjang (Korean fermented soybean paste)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (15g) coarse ground gochugaru (Korean chile powder)</li>
        <li>1 quart (950ml) homemade chicken stock or store-bought low sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds (680g) Yukon gold potatoes, about 2 to 3 inches in diameter, peeled </li>
        <li>12 ounces (340g) daikon radish, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/4 head green cabbage (about 10 1/2 ounces; 300g), cored (reserve core for garnish), leaves separated</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (40g) perilla seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For Serving</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 scallions (about 60g), sliced 1/4-inch-thick on a steep bias</li>
        <li>10 to 12 perilla leaves (about 20g), stemmed and torn into quarters</li>
        <li>1 hot Korean long pepper or serrano chile, stemmed and thinly sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>Thinly sliced green cabbage core</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the Gamja-tang: Season ribs on all sides with salt. In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high
            heat until just smoking. Add half of the ribs, meat side down, and cook, turning occasionally, until browned
            on both sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer browned ribs to a plate and set aside. Repeat browning process with
            remaining ribs, then let browned ribs rest for 5 minutes. Using a sharp knife, cut between ribs to separate
            into single-rib pieces. Return ribs to plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Lower heat to medium-low and add onion to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is slightly
            softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, gochugaru, and doenjang and continue to cook until aromatic,
            about 1 minute. Add chicken stock, fish sauce, and potatoes, and return ribs to pot along with any
            accumulated juices. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer, cover, and cook until potatoes are
            slightly tender on the exterior but still firm at the center, so that they offer resistance when poked with
            a paring knife, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove lid, stir in daikon radish, and arrange cabbage leaves in an even layer over the surface of the stew
            to form a lid. Continue to cook, adjusting heat as needed to maintain a simmer, until potatoes are fully
            cooked through, offering little resistance when poked with a paring knife, and daikon is just tender, about
            30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, grind perilla seeds into a coarse powder. Set aside 2
            teaspoons of the crushed perilla seeds and, once potatoes are cooked through, add the rest to the stew.
            Gently stir to incorporate perilla seeds and cabbage leaves into the stew.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook until meat on ribs is fully tender, offering minimal resistance when poked with a paring
            knife, and potatoes have begun to break down slightly, thickening the stew, about 20 minutes longer. Season
            with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>For Serving: Divide stew between individual serving bowls, topping each portion with scallions, perilla
            leaves, chile (if using), and sliced cabbage core. Serve immediately.</li>
