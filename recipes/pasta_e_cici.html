    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pasta e Cici, is a brothy pasta dish similar to minestrone or fagioli. A tomato forward borth, chickpeas and
        a short pasta (such as ditalini) come together to make a filling, rustic dish.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
        <li>4 medium garlic cloves (20g), lightly crushed</li>
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30g) tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) dry white wine</li>
        <li>3 cups (1 pound 2 ounces; 510g) cooked dry chickpeas or two (15-ounce; 425g) cans low-sodium chickpeas,
            drained and rinsed, divided</li>
        <li>4 cups (950ml) chickpea cooking liquid, homemade chicken or vegetable stock, or store-bought low-sodium
            chicken stock, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>8 ounces (225g) small tubular pasta, such as ditalini</li>
        <li>2 ounces (55g) finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese, plus extra for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic and rosemary, season lightly
            with salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until garlic softens and turns golden, about 5 minutes. Add pepper
            flakes and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomato paste and
            cook until tomato paste is fragrant and turns dark brick red, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in wine, scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon. Bring to a simmer, and cook until wine has
            emulsified with olive oil and mixture is slightly reduced, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>If using cooked dry chickpeas: Stir in 1 cup (170g) chickpeas and 1 cup (240ml) chickpea cooking liquid.
            Using a potato masher or wooden spoon, mash chickpeas against the sides and bottom of the pot until
            completely broken down. Stir in the rest of the chickpeas and remaining 3 cups (710ml) cooking liquid
            (supplementing with stock or water as needed to reach 3 cups), and black pepper. Season with salt to taste.
            Proceed to Step 4.

            If using canned chickpeas: Remove Dutch oven from heat; remove and discard rosemary sprig. Add 1 cup (170g)
            chickpeas and 1 cup (240ml) stock, and using an immersion blender, blend mixture until smooth, 1 to 2
            minutes. (If you do not have a handheld immersion blender, transfer mixture to blender and blend until
            smooth, about 1 minute. Pour mixture back into Dutch oven.) Stir in remaining 2 cups (340ml) of chickpeas, 3
            cups (710ml) stock, and black pepper. Season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Bring chickpea mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in pasta and cook, stirring frequently, until
            pasta is just shy of al dente (1 to 2 minutes less than the package directs, as the pasta will continue to
            cook off-heat), and liquid is reduced to a consistency that falls between soupy and saucy. Adjust
            consistency as needed with additional water, stock, or chickpea cooking liquid, keeping in mind that liquid
            will tighten up as it cools due to starch from the chickpeas.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, add cheese, and stir rapidly to incorporate. Season with salt to taste. Divide between
            individual serving bowls (for the dried chickpea version, look out for the garlic cloves and rosemary sprig;
            remove and discard them), and drizzle each serving with olive oil. Serve, passing extra grated cheese at the
            table.</li>
    </ol>
